# Mailing Script
Two simple scripts to send emails.
- mail.py is used to send emails from a .csv file using gmail servers.
- script.py is used for custom domains, through cpanel logins.

# Requirement
Any system with python 3 (preferably 3.6) and terminal.

# Usage
- Navigate to the file directory where the downloaded file (the script file) is stored using the cd command in the terminal or cmd.
- Update necessary details like login details and server port.
- Copy the database in a .csv format.
- Type python filename.py, where filename depends whether you are running for you're custom server or the gmail server.
- Trigger the script by pressing enter/return
